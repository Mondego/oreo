# Oreo
 Source code clones are categorized into four types of increasing difficulty of detection, ranging from purely textual (Type-1) to purely semantic (Type-4). Most clone detectors reported in the literature work well up to Type-3, which accounts for syntactic differences. In between Type-3 and Type-4, however, there lies a spectrum of clones that, although still exhibiting some syntactic similarities, are extremely hard to detect â€“ the Twilight Zone. Most clone detectors reported in the literature fail to operate in this zone. Oreo is a novel approach to source code clone detection that not only detects Type-1 to Type-3 clones accurately, but is also capable of detecting harder-to-detect clones in the Twilight Zone. Oreo is built using a combination of machine learning, information retrieval, and software metrics. We evaluate the recall of Oreo on BigCloneBench, and perform manual evaluation for precision. Oreo has both high recall and precision. More importantly, it pushes the boundary in detection of clones with moderate to weak syntactic similarity in a scalable manner.

## Clone Oreo Repository
 Clone the Oreo repository, preferably the version which we have tagged as -Oreo_FSE.
 The Oreo is under constant active development and therefore more recent versions might not be very stable. We will release more tags in future when we have more stable version.


## Generate Input for Oreo
 To be able to find method level clone pairs using Oreo, you will need to provide an input file on which Oreo will detect clone pairs.
 To generate this input file you can use a tool called `Metric Calculator`, which we provide with Oreo. The tool needs to know the path of the dataset for which this input file needs to be created.
 We support dataset in various formats like `zip`, or usual `linux directory`. If the dataset is presented as a `zip` file, the Metric Claculator will go throught the zip will and all the subdirectories inside it looking for the .java files. It will then calculate metrics of the methods found in these files. And finally it will create an output file where each line corresponds to information about one method. This file then can be used as an input to Oreo.

 Follow the following steps to generate input
```
 In a terminal, go to the root folder of Oreo.
 Change directory to java-parser

 run ant command to create the needed jar:

 ant metric
 ```
 then, again change the directory to the root folder of Oreo, and then change to python_scripts directory
 there, you need to run the `metricCalculationWorkManager.py` script that launches the jar file for metric calculation. This script should be run as follows:
 ```
 python3 metricCalculationWorkManager.py <number of processes> <type of input which is either directory or zip> <absolute path to input>
 ```
 `<number of processes>` can be any number of processes you want to execute this script with. To make the execution process simple, set this number to 1; however, one can specify any number he/she desires to.
 `<type of input which is either directory or zip>` enter `d` if your input type is directory, and enter `z` if it is `zip`
 `<absolute path to input>` enter the absolute path to your input directory or input the `zip` or `tgz` file.
After issuing this command, look for two files in the same directory: metric.out and metric.err. Any possible error will be printed in metric.out file, and metric.err shows the progress of metric calculation process. Once the process is ended, done! will be printed in the last line of metric.out file.
 When the process ends, you will have several sub-directories created in the `python_scripts` directory based on the number of processes you have specified. These files are in the format of `<number>_metric_output` where `<number>` is the process number. Since in our example the number of processes is 1, there would be a single sub-directory named `1_metric_output`. Inside this sub-directory, there is an output file named `mlcc_input.file`. This file will be used as an input for Oreo. Please note that if you have executed `metricCalculationWorkManager.py` with several processes, you will have several `<number>_metric_output`  files (equal to the number of processes you have speficied), and you need to concatenate all `mlcc_input.file` files inside each process's sub-directory to have a single file. In our example of having one process, you just need `mlcc_input.file` which is inside `1_metric_output` subdirectory.

## Setting Up Oreo

Before going futher, make sure you have Java 8 and Python3.6 installed.

 ```
 change directory to oreo/clone-detector/input/dataset/
 Copy the above file (mlcc_input.file) to this location and rename the file to blocks.file. Make sure there is no other file present at this location.
 ```
 Oreo has two components, one which produces possible candidates
 and other which consumes this candidates and predicts whether they are clone pairs or not.
 To run Oreo, we need to tell Oreo where these candidates will be generated.
 ```
 now change the directory to Oreo's root directory, and then too clone-detector. That is to oreo/clone-detector/
 open the file sourcerercc.properties.
 ```
 (we reused a lot of code from SourcererCC to make Oreo, and hence the name sourcerercc.properties.)
 ```
 change the value of the property CANDIDATES_DIR to contain
 the absolute path where you want the possible candidate clone pairs to be generated.

 Now open oreo/python_scripts/Predictor.py in an editor.
 In this file, you need to provide paths to 3 variables.


 self.candidates_dir. This path should be same as the path provided in sourcerercc.properties (CANDIDATES_DIR)

 self.output_dir. The absolute path to the directory where you want the clone pairs to be reported.

 self.modelfilename_type31. the absolute path to the trained model
 which will be used by the Predictor.

 This trained model can be downloaded from this link:

 ```
 ### Install dependencies.
 The best way to install dependencies is by creating a virtual evironment (venv) for Python.
 Create a virtual environment using following command
 ```
 python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
 ```

 Start the virtual environment:
```
 source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
```
 Change to oreo/python_scripts/dependencies/ directory
 run following command to install the dependencies
 ```
 pip install -r dependencies.txt
```
 ## Running Oreo
 After settip up Oreo, follow the following steps to run it.

 Change the directory to the root of Oreo, and then to clone-detector. There, run following command.

 `python controller.py 1`

 This will run the code to generate candidate pairs.
 Now, open another terminal and change directory to oreo/python_scripts. and Run following command

 `./runPredictor.sh`

 This will consume candidates and produce clone pairs in the output directory.
